# Multiplication Table

This project provides simple implementations of a multiplication table generator in both **Java** and **Python**. It helps users input a number and view its multiplication table from 1 to 10.

---

## Features

- **Input Validation**: Ensures user inputs are valid numbers.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Prevents calculating the table for 0.
  - Prompts the user if invalid input is detected.
- **Iterative Display**: Continuously prompts users to input numbers until manually terminated.
